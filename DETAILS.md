This repository is for the IST Computer Club

Here is some basic information:
- It takes place every Friday lunchtime from 13:30 to 14:00
- I teach Python
- I help the member with teir ICT/IT schoolwork and/or homework (The teacher doesn't give them much/any homework)
- I am fluent in Python 3.11, Java 21, Batch (Windows command line)

Here is the seesion structure (the template at least):

- 5-10 minutes of helping the members with their schoolwork/homework
- 5-10 minutes of presenting that session's powerpoint presentation
- 5-10 mintues of letting them code, and I walk about, helping with any issues.

The Issues tab is for questions when you cannot get hold of me.


Personal Interests:
I don't wish to divulge too much about myself but here goes...

  I wish to become a Commerical Pilot
  I love coding, I can easily spend too much time on Java.
  I use my Java coding knowledge to make Minecraft mods (for Fabric, as it is the best)
  I tend to keep to myself.
