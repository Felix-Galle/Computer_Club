This repository is for the IST Computer Club

Here is some basic information:
- It takes place every Friday lunchtime from 13:30 to 14:00
- I teach Python
- I help the member with teir ICT/IT schoolwork and/or homework (The teacher doesn't give them much/any homework)
- I am fluent in Python 3.11, Java 21, Batch (Windows command line)

Here is the seesion structure (the template at least):

- 5-10 minutes of helping the members with their schoolwork/homework
- 5-10 minutes of presenting that session's powerpoint presentation
- 5-10 mintues of letting them code, and I walk about, helping with any issues.

The Issues tab is for questions when you cannot get hold of me.

bug - This one is for any issues with code that I have provided, I am not a robot and will certainly make mistakes.
duplicate - This one is for if I have accidently duplicated something. 
enhancement - This one is for any suggestions as to how I can make my lessons/teaching better. I can always improve
help wanted - This one is for any time you want help with your code, or something for your ICT/IT lessons. 
Be aware that there are specific criteria set out for me helping. If they are not met, I may be unable to help.
question - This one is for if you have any general questions. e.g. You didn't understand the way I explained something.

Personal Interests:
I don't wish to divulge too much about myself but here goes...

  I wish to become a Commerical Pilot
  I love coding, I can easily spend too much time on VSCode.
  I use my Java coding knowledge to make Minecraft mods (for Fabric, as it is the best)
  I tend to keep to myself.
